    <p>
    Before I had the privilege of writing for a living, I worked in Silicon Valley. I'd been designing websites since I was eight years old, and after college I landed a job as employee number one at a startup in San Francisco. The company was part of Y Combinator, the most successful startup accelerator in the world — they gave the very first funding to companies like Dropbox and Reddit, and the company I worked at was in the same batch of startups as Airbnb. So I got a front-row seat to that world, at a time when there was a second dot-com boom starting to take off.
    </p><p>
    I realized pretty quickly that the tech industry wasn't for me — I just couldn't find much meaning in the work — but as something to observe, it was incredibly fascinating. The startup world was filled with people who were basically my age, with the same amount of uncertainty and immaturity and idealism and naive ambition as any other twentysomething — but they had all this power. And a really profound thing I learned is that technology is not this inevitable path we're walking. It can seem that way when you're a consumer of it, but really, there are people who consciously decide what to create, and their decisions end up shaping our lives.
    </p><p>
    I knew this was a world I had to write about. And I knew I didn't want to write about guys in a garage in Palo Alto, bootstrapping an idea, starting from nothing. I wanted to write about people who've already built something big and now stand with the world at their feet, trying to decide where to step. Young people of a specific generation — my generation — who are thrust into unexpected power and forced to decide how they're going to use it, all in this specific era we're living in, this crazy moment in history when absolutely nothing is certain anymore, and the future is waiting to be written.
    </p><p>
    That's what The Informers is about.
    </p><p>
    In the pilot, we're introduced to two of our main characters: Dash and Preston. They're 26, they've been best friends since kindergarten, and they're the founders of a social media startup called Areal, which is eighteen months old and already has sixty million users. <span class="h">What makes Areal different from existing social media is that it shows you things based on real-life physical proximity. It’s all about what’s around you, and the radius can be anything from the room you’re in, to your neighborhood, to an entire city.</span>
    </p><p>
    When we meet these two characters, they're facing the most monumental decision of their lives. Facebook has offered to buy them for three billion dollars. Each of them will take home twenty percent of that: six hundred million apiece. Taking that deal might seem like a no-brainer, but what that money really represents is how much of a threat they are to the heavyweights. If they keep going on their own, they could become the next Facebook. Or they could just as easily fade away, and become the next Friendster.
    </p><p>
    Dash and Preston have an unshakeable bond, but they're two very different people, with complementary talents. Dash has a super sharp understanding of human nature and human desire; he's never written a line of code in his life, but he's the visionary who's designed Areal's massively popular app. Preston is a brilliant engineer, and one of the top coders of his generation; he's the one responsible for actually building the product, even though most people know Dash as the CEO and the public face.
    </p><p>
    When the pilot opens, these two have agreed on their decision: they're going to take the deal and sell their company. Dash is the one who's more keen on cashing out: even though he's great at what he does, he's a bit like I was, in that he just doesn't find it meaningful — he's like, “We've made a new way for people to distract themselves, who cares.” What he really wants is to just be free of all his responsibilities and move to Europe with his girlfriend and disengage from the world. But Preston feels like this is maybe the one great idea they'll have in their lives, and it might be foolish not to take it as far as they can. Dash appeals to Preston's rational side and convinces him to do the cautious thing and take the money while they can.
    </p><p>
    Obviously, I'm not pitching a show about two insanely rich 26-year-olds lying on a beach. They end up backing away from their decision. The exciting part is how and why.
    </p><p>
    There's a third main character: a young woman named Mallory. She's a journalist. She’s ambitious, idealistic. She aspires to do really important, world-changing work. At one point in the pilot, she mentions to another character that, growing up, all her friends wanted to be Carrie Bradshaw; she wanted to be Carl Bernstein. When we meet her, she’s working for an online news startup called Delve. The company was launched with a mission to do serious, hard-hitting journalism, but now it’s running out of cash, and it’s shifting to shallow viral content just to keep the lights on.
    </p><p>
    In the pilot, Mallory meets Dash to interview him for a profile she's been assigned to write. They end up hitting it off. He finds himself drawn to her fiery passion for making the world a better place, which is currently being thwarted by the constraints of her job. And she ends up revealing some astonishing things to Dash about how his app is being used. Things he was completely unaware of. It turns out Areal is being widely adopted as a platform for activism and social justice, and it's actually enabling concrete results, on a local level, across America and throughout the world.
    </p><p>
    Dash has never been an activist-y guy. He's not indifferent to the world's problems, but he always felt that he didn't have much power to change things, and so he doesn't see much point to tweeting a hashtag or marching in a protest. But now he realizes he's actually stumbled into that power, and his encounter with Mallory leads to an awakening of his social conscience. 
    </p><p>
    Meanwhile, Preston is experiencing an awakening of his own. <span class="h">What Preston values most is freedom. He started a company in part because he liked the idea of not having a boss, and deciding his own fate. But now that he's gained a bit of power, he's realizing that, to him, true freedom means being one of the people who decide what happens in the world, and not letting others write the future in which he'll live. Now that he's conquered a little piece of the world, he’s fearing a loss of control, and he’s feeling a lust for empire.</span>
    </p><p>
    So, for very different reasons, Dash and Preston end up being aligned in their choice to turn down the acquisition and forge ahead on their own. But each of them is kind of blissfully unaware of what's going on within the other; they’re starting to grow in different directions, and that conflict between their emerging values is eventually going to burst into the open and threaten their friendship. And Dash has made promises to his girlfriend Fiona about the life they’ll have together when he cashes out and leaves the company. They’ve been hoping and planning and dreaming about that life. He knows that by changing his mind, he’s dealing a blow to their relationship. He sees himself as sacrificing his personal life for the greater good, but he has no idea how much this all could cost him.
    </p><p>
    From the pilot all through the first season and beyond, this is a show about what happens when you love someone and you have a dream that’s in collision with theirs. We’ll use exciting character-driven drama to explore big, timely themes, and we’ll dig into intensely relevant questions around things like free speech and online censorship — the kinds of questions being faced right now by companies like Facebook and Twitter. The first season is a battle between Dash and Preston for the soul of their company: is it going to be a conscious vehicle for change, or is it just going to be this agnostic platform that only exists to get more users?
    </p><p>
    Right now, I’ll briefly go through some of the plot points I have in mind for season one. This is all provisional, of course, but I hope it gives you a sense of what this show can do and where it can go. 
    </p><p>
    Early in the season, Dash tries to broaden the company’s mission and inject it with a social conscience. But Preston wants to be careful — he thinks they need to stay apolitical, the way that other succcesful platforms have. This is the beginning of the struggle that’s going to play out across the whole season. Preston wins the first battle, but as a kind of consolation prize, Dash gets to act on a bold idea: he has Areal buy Delve, the news platform Mallory works for. Now she’s right in the thick of it with Preston and Dash.
    </p><p>
    Soon after, Mallory uncovers a huge story developing in the Middle East: an Arab Spring-style revolution is brewing in (let’s say) Saudi Arabia, and the young people leading the movement are using Areal to organize their protests. The Saudi government threatens to block the app, and Dash and Preston are faced with a choice between censoring their content or pulling out of the country altogether. But Dash and Mallory refuse to accept that these are the only two options — they want to find a way to help the activists, and they manage to sway Preston to their side. The three of them develop a plan: they’ll create the appearance of censorship while secretly giving the rebels encryption tools that let them communicate safely.
    </p><p>
    And here, we see an example of how versatile this show can be: technology affects so many aspects of our world that we can venture into realms like geopolitics without ever leaving our main characters, and the show can take on the urgency of a high-stakes thriller without having to shift its tone or its setting.
    </p><p class="h">
    In the first half of the season, we’ll establish some of the main threats to Dash and Preston — both to their company, and to their friendship. What’s great about building a drama around an established tech startup is that existential threats are everywhere — and they’re different at each stage of the company’s growth, so they can develop and change every season. In season one, the threats are: Areal’s investors, who are pissed about losing out on their three-billion-dollar windfall; the major players in their space, who are desperate to wipe them out; and the enemies they’ll create anytime they try to take a political stance. And early on, we’ll set up a goalpost lying at the end of the season: Areal’s IPO, which is a real make-or-break moment in the company’s life.
    </p><p class="h">
      One of the big threats to Dash and Preston’s friendship comes in the form of a new character: a seasoned Silicon Valley exec who Preston brings in to serve as chief operating officer. She’s the “adult supervision”, playing the role of a Sheryl Sandberg or an Eric Schmidt. She’s super smart and super tough, and she starts to exert a lot of influence right away; and as her power grows, so does Preston’s.
    </p><p>    
    In the final episodes of the season, Dash and Preston have their most heated conflict ever, over the issue of censoring hate speech. It’s a time when attacks against immigrants and Muslims are accelerating all over the country, thanks in part to Areal making it easier for hate groups to organize, and Dash feels culpable. Preston is sympathetic, but he believes there are limits to the actions they can take, and he has the investors and the other executives on his side. This is when Dash goes rogue. In one fell swoop, he purges the hate groups from the platform.
    </p><p>
    Pretty soon, there’s retaliation: Areal is hit with a massive cyberattack that causes tremendous damage to its users. The company is weeks away from an IPO and the stakes have never been higher. Preston tears into Dash for his recklessness. It’s the angriest he’s ever been in his life, and the lowest point in their friendship.
    </p><p>
    After this, it all comes crashing down for Dash: he’s forced out of the company with only a small fraction of the shares he had; and his personal life falls apart too, as his girlfriend, Fiona, comes to realize that he’s in love with Mallory and he’s in love with the idea of making a difference, but he’s no longer in love with her. At the end of the season, he and Mallory head off to Berkeley, her hometown, to launch a new, ambitious startup that will be explicitly aimed at fostering social change. And Areal has a gangbusters IPO with Preston installed as the new CEO.
    </p><p>
    Dash and Preston won’t stay apart forever — their friendship is the backbone of this series. In season two, we’ll see Dash struggle to make lightning strike twice, and Preston struggle to run his company without Dash’s help; and slowly but surely, they’ll be drawn back together.
    </p><p>
    In telling these stories, I’d aim to use the tried-and-true Hill Street Blues model of series arcs, multi-episode arcs, and episodic arcs. The primary setting will be the offices of Areal, which are located in New York — not Silicon Valley — but we'll also track the characters through their personal lives, outside of work, and, through our characters, we'll occasionally drop into worlds adjacent to technology, like media and politics.
    </p><p>
    In terms of tone, the main influence is Aaron Sorkin's work — though to me, the key reference point isn’t The Social Network, but rather The West Wing. What made that show great was that it was about characters who are decent, who love each other, who are the best at what they do, and who’ve arrived in a position of power and now find themselves struggling to make things better. Like The West Wing, this is a kind of palace drama for our time — but in the 21st century, it feels increasingly like the real seat of power is no longer America's government, but instead, its tech companies.
    </p><p>
    When I first sat down and wrote this pilot, a big part of why I wanted to write it was that there hadn't been a dramatic series about millennials. We've had a bunch of excellent half-hour shows: Girls, Master of None, Insecure. But those shows are all pretty focused on individual experience within a specific terrain: finding love, choosing a career, managing relationships. It's all very authentic to a certain facet of this generation's experiences, but there's this whole other aspect that hasn't been explored, and that side of things has more to do with our collective ambitions.
    </p><p>
    We're a generation that came of age during a long period of crisis — 9/11, two wars, a massive recession — but it's also been a period of profound technological and cultural change, where so much has seemed possible — and we've come out of it all with this interesting mix of hope and cynicism, and these lofty goals which we know may not be realized. And now we're facing a world that's in peril, and we're each asking ourselves, "What are my responsibilities? What can I do, and what should I sacrifice, to make things better?" And I, for one, would love to see a show that tackles those ideas, and really captures the way that young people are confronting the world that exists right now. I've been hungering for that show. And that's why I wrote this one.
